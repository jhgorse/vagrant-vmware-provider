Vagrant VMware Provider.

This is a free alternative to HashiCorp's paid for VMWare Fusion/Desktop provider.

Requirements: Fusion Pro 7

Features:
- Customizing VAGRANT_VMWARE_CLONE_DIRECTORY
- Basic VMX customizations (same way as in the manual)

Not supported yet:
- Shared folders (rsync only)

Zero testing on Windows, but works okay here with VMware Fusion 7.1.1.

Happy to accept PRs but no support is provided for this, if you need support or shared folders
use HashiCorp's paid for provider since vagrant is awesome software.
